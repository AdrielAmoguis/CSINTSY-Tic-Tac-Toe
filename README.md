## Language & Dependencies
Java is the selected language for this project. Java was selected because of its object-oriented paradigm and the ease of use of its UI framework, JavaFX.
- Java SDK 14
- JavaFX 11

## Compilation
In the ```src``` folder, execute:
> ``` javac mainPackage/*.java mainPackage/Model/*.java --module-path "C:\JavaFX\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml ```

## To Run
In the ```src``` folder, execute:
> ``` java --module-path "C:\JavaFX\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml mainPackage.Main ```

This goes without saying that "C:\JavaFX\lib" must be replaced with the installation directory of your own JavaFX runtime library.
